# Synfonia

A music-oriented media player built with [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/) and our own fork of [SharpAudio with FFMPEG Integration](https://github.com/jmacato/SharpAudio).  

## Features:

- It can play any audio format that FFMPEG supports. 
- Gapless & seamless playback between tracks.
- Custom album art fetching.
- Can run on Windows (x86-64), Linux (x86-64/ARM/ARM64) and macOS (x86-64/ARM64). 
- Uses modern Microsoft Fluent UI design language for that slick look.

## OS-Specific Instructions

For macOS:
  
   - install Homebrew and run `brew install ffmpeg openal-soft`.

For Debian-based Linux systems

   - `sudo apt install ffmpeg openal-soft`
